/**
 * Behaviral description of SpecialPage:WitnessPublisher
 * The SpecialPage prints out the database witness_events in decending order (starting with the latest witness event). If a page manifest was not yet published, the page should hold a publish button instead of the empty field for 'page_witness_transaction_hash'. In this list it is easy to see how many Witness Events have taken place and which receipts in the form of the page_manifests have been generated and whats their page link (they should be clickable to be redireted to the respective page manifest).
